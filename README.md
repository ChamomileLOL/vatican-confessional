# VATICAN OS: The Incorruptible Confessional

> "Debuggare humanum est, compilare divinum." (To debug is human, to compile is divine.)

### CERTIFICATE OF CANONIZATION

**Pontiff:** Pope Francis Xavier I
**Ordinal:** The First
**Logic:** Strict Equality (===)
**Precision:** Infinite (String-based Arithmetic)

### THE DOGMA

1. **No Floating Points:** All financial data is stored as Strings to avoid the heresy of `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3`.
2. **No Data Loss:** Offline transactions are queued in Purgatory (LocalStorage) and synced via the Mergesort of Time.
3. **No External Math:** We implemented `holyAdd` and `holySubtract` from scratch.

*Veritas in Codice.* (Truth in Code.)
